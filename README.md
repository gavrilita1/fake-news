Problem Presentation

The term „fake news” refers to a piece of information that introduces a discrepancy in the way in
which it represents reality, usually meaning said piece of information is either exaggerated or
blatantly false.
Sources disseminating false information have increased in number in the 2016 United States

Presidential Election, especially through the Twitter social media platform, with the help of so-
called „tweets”.

A tweet is a post by any user of Twitter on the Twitter platform. It contains data that can be used
in determining if the post can be categorized as false, mostly true or true.
The other relevant entity is the Twitter user’s account. Said entity has certain properties that can
indicate whether the probability of false information dissemination by the user is high or low.
We propose a model for detecting sources disseminating false information on the Twitter social
media platform. Each of the analyzed tweets will be subjected to the same algorithm, which will
return the probability of the tweet being a reliable source of information.
